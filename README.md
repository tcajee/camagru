## Tools & Technologies
#### Back-end:
- Apache:  An open source web server and the most widely used server worldwide for delivery of web content. Used to  serves the project on localhost for development.
- PHP: A general-purpose language suited for web development (requirement of the project).
#### Front-end:
- HTML: The standard markup language used to develop web Pages. It only defines the layout of the page contents. 
- CSS: Used to define the style of the website. It augments HTML and can be used to create semi-dynamic websites.
- JavaScript: A programming language that is often used alongside HTML and CSS to make dynamic websites. It is usually referred to as the language of the web because of its strong compatibility with web browsers and HTML.
#### Data Management System (DBMS):
- MariaDB: An open source SQL server used as the primary database driver along with the Structured Query Language we used for the project database queries.
